# Discord.js Bot Template

### Before doing anything, you need to:
- Visit [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create an application, turn on the `Bot` feature, and invite its to your server.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the version must be atleast 12.x or above.
- Have a place to host your bot.
  - You can use [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to code your bot but it won't run forever.
  - Here is some free host that you can use: [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com), [Repl.it](https://replit.com), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  - I wouldn't recommend using a free host, they have limitations.

### After you finished all of that ^^^
- Put these code into your host.
- Go to `config.js` and change them.

### To run your bot:
- Open the terminal/console and type in `node .` or `node <your main file name>`.
- Or just click start if your host have one.
